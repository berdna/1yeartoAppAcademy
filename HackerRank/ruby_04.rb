Three variables a, b, and c are already defined. 
Your task is to write code that checks whether a is within the range of b and c by calling the method range? 
(which we have defined for you as a method for this example) on a and passing b and c as arguments.

a.range?(b, c)

or 

return a.range?(b, c)
